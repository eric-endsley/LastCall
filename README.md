_The Last Call website helps people to know more about beer and finds breweries nearby. <br>
The website contains the following pages:_

1. _Age verification_ - It checks the user age. User must be 21 years or older.
2. _Beer 101_ - This is informational page about beer history, how beer is made, ingredients, key beer terms, types of beer.
3. _Brewery Finder_ - This page queries three API's (google maps, mapquest, Beermapping) to provide a sorted list of breweries within a specified search radius from the user's address. Links to google maps directions are also automatically generated on this page. 4
    * To use this feature, navigate to the breweryfinder.html page by clicking "Find Beer" in the upper left hand corner of the webpage. 
    * Enter your desired search radius and your address and click submit.
